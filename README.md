# ðŸš² Bike Share Usage Analytics Dashboard

## Goal 
I developed a interactive and insightful data visualization dashboard that analyzes and identifies bike usage patterns for better decision-making among bike-sharing programs in urban areas. The dashboard focuses on identifying various trends among variable types, popular routes, and user behavior with the use of real-world bikeshare datasets for better support toward strategic decision making with a focus on transportation optimization, predictive analytics, and operational efficiency. 

## Insights
- Identified peak ride hours and high-demand stations/routes for optimal bike station distribution.
- Segmented users by bike (Electric VS Regular) and rider types (Member VS Casual), revealing usage behavior for targeted services improvements
- Applied K-Means clustering to show distinct user behavior patterns
- Dectect Loop rides (15%) that demonstrated recreational usage around certain areas
- Built predictive forecasting model (Prophe5) of bike rides usage for the next month with 85%+ accuracy.
- Rush Hour indicators based on days of the week and amount of rides


## Dataset
Public Citibike NYC dataset with 85,000+ ride records are utilized for this visualization given station names, timestamps, user's metadata, and geolocations.

## Data Wrangling
- Cleaned data with python, handled missing values, normalized timestamps, and engineered time-based features like querying for ride duration given start and end times of each ride.
- Aggregated, queried and modeled data in SQL and Power BI for performance, predictability, and flexibility. 

## Tools
  MySQL, MySQL Workbench, Power BI, Tableau, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Prophet, Matplotlib), SQL, DAX and Power Query


## Visualization
Produced interactive dashboard using Tableau. More advanced data visualizations are located in Power BI dashboard.
