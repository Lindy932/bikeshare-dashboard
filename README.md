# ðŸš² Bike Share Usage Analytics Dashboard

## Goal 
I developed a interactive and insightful data visualization dashboard that analyzes and identifies bike usage patterns for better decision-making among bike-sharing programs in urban areas. The dashboard focuses on identifying various trends among variable types, popular routes, and user behavior with the use of real-world bikeshare datasets for better support toward data-driven decisions for transportation planning.

## Insights
- Identified peak ride hours and high-demand stations/routes
- Segmented users by bike and rider types, revealing usage patterns for targeted services and identifying characteristics for better accuracy in bikeshare stations installations
- Applied clustering to uncover distinct user behavior patterns
- Loop rides (15%) demonstrated recreational usage
- Built predictive forecasting model of bike rides usage with 85%+ accuracy.


## Dataset


## Data Wrangling
- Processed large-scale CitiBike Bikeshare Data with over 85,000+ records
- Cleaned data with python, handled missing values, normalized timestamps, and engineered time-based features like querying for ride duration given start and end times of each ride.
- Aggregated and modeled data in SQL and Power BI for performance, predictability, and flexibility. 

## Tools
  MySQL, MySQL Workbench, Power BI, Tableau, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Prophet, Matplotlib), SQL, DAX and Power Query


## Visualization
Produced interactive dashboard using Tableau. More advanced data visualizations are located in Power BI dashboard.
